# WicNet
.NET Core interop classes for WIC (Windows Imaging Component) Direct2D, and DirectWrite,

This is an AOT-friendly version of [WicNet](https://github.com/smourier/WicNet).
Aimed at x64 targets (doesn't mean it won't work for x86 targets, but it may not work for ambiguous types)
Only for .NET Core 9 and beyond, it won't work for version below 9 or with .NET Framework.
